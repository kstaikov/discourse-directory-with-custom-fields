- rename newdirs to... directory?
- style touchup/css


To Launch
=========
- replace user_field_3 with whatever the actual one i need is.
- mimic same fields as in 307adair, same order.  make sure it works.

Nice to have for 0.2
============
- search by user/name
- Figure out if i can get the field map in... how.  accessible on the front end.  ajax call instead?  Display on directory whatever we get here.
- Configure in admin which fields to display on the directory and accomplish that.
- Figure out what to do with the fields exactly - building and # separate?  Joined later?
- Add sortability on all fields on the frontend
