Nice to have for 0.2
============
- search by user/name
- Figure out if i can get the field map in... how.  accessible on the front end.  ajax call instead?  Display on directory whatever we get here.
- Configure in admin which fields to display on the directory and accomplish that.
- Figure out what to do with the fields exactly - building and # separate?  Joined later?
- Add sortability on all fields on the frontend
- do css styling.
- prettify mobile a bit.
- if people are in the same unit they share a directory row.
- Maybe a separate plugin for townhomes specifically - automatically creates the unit/building/phone etc. fields.
- Maybe an owner field.
